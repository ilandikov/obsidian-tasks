# Limiting

## Total tasks

You can limit the number of total tasks to show as query results.
Use the query string `limit to <number> tasks`.
This will only list the `<number>` first results of the query.

Shorthand is `limit <number>`.

## Tasks per group

You can also limit the max number of tasks in groups if grouping is used. Otherwise this limit is ignored.
Use the query string `limit groups to <number> tasks`.
This will only list the `<number>` first tasks in each group from the results of the query.

Shorthand is `limit groups <number>`.
