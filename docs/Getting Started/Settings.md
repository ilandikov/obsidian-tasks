# Settings

## Restart after changing settings

Changes to most of the Tasks settings take immediate effect.

Regrettably, a few require the vault to be reloaded. These settings are marked with `REQUIRES RESTART`.

## Available settings

As the number of options in Tasks has grown, we have documented each setting in the page for the relevant topic.

For convenience, here is a list of all those documentation pages (in the order the options appear in the Tasks Settings pane):

- [[About Task Formats#Selecting the task format|Task Formats]]
- [[Global Filter#Settings for the Global Filter|Global Filter]]
- [[Global Query#Settings|Global Query]]
- [[Status Settings#Overview|Status Settings]]
- [[Dates#Date-tracking settings|Dates]]
- [[Use Filename as Default Date#Settings|Use Filename as Default Date]]
- [[Recurring Tasks#Recurrence Settings|Recurring Tasks]]
- [[Auto-Suggest#Settings|Auto-Suggest]]
- [[Create or edit Task#Turning off keyboard shortcuts|Create or edit Task modal]]
